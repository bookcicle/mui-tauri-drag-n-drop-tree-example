# Tauri + React + MUI Tree

## Tree Drag And Drop does not work on MacOS

To run 

Head over to Tauri and follow setup instructions, or simply run this to setup a new project and it will run your through what is missing

```
npm create tauri-app@latest 
```

Use node 22 if on NVM
```
nvm use 22
```

```
npm install
npm run tauri dev
```

Tested on Linux and works as expected there. Will be testing on Windows shortly.
